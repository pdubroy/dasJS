# dasJS: Experiments in post-modern JavaScript

dasJS is a collection of experiments in augmenting JavaScript with various
new language features, such as:

* dynamic scoping
* Common Lisp-style [conditions and restarts](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/beyond-exception-handling-conditions-and-restarts.html)
* pattern-based control flow

Some features (such as dynamic scoping) are implemented using pure-JavaScript
syntax with special restrictions, and others use new syntax. Everything
compiles down to valid JavaScript so that it could actually be used in
production code.
